## Prompt(s):

-   "start \<- 1987

    end \<- 1992

    df_combined \<- NULL

    for (year in start:end){

    path \<- str_c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES-6100-data-science/master/datasets/buoydata/44013\_", year, ".csv", sep = "")

    df \<- read_csv(path) \|\>

    select(YY, MM, WVHT, WTMP) \|\>

    rename(years = YY, month = MM, wave_heights = WVHT, temperature = WTMP) \|\>

    sort_by(month) \|\>

    summarise(temperature_c_mean = mean(temperature), wave_height_mean = mean(wave_heights))

    df_combined \<- bind_rows(df_combined, df)

    }

    Error in df_combined :

    The pipe operator requires a function call as RHS (\<input\>:8:3)

    Error during wrapup: not that many frames on the stack

    Error: no more error handlers available (recursive errors?); invoking 'abort' restart\
    \
    Why is this code not working?"

## AI output summary:

-   It says there is no sort_by() function and that I might have meant group_by().

## Edits made and rationale:

-   I edited the function to read as group_by() and also read the documentation for this function to make sure I am using it correctly. I changed this because I had initially misremembered what the function was called. Now, I remember function.

## Verification:

-   The code ran after that. In the console, I typed in View(df_combined) to make sure the dataframe looks as I want, which it did.
